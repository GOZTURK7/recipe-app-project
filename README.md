## Installing Dependencies
___

* I have used https://spoonacular.com/ api as my project api, so yo need to go subscribe and get api key from there for free, after subscribing you can get api key from your profile like below;

    > ![api key](./src/assets/img/apiKey%20page.png)

    > this api key is provide you **150 points** fetch ability per day but dont worry, I have used the **localstorage** in my project to cache the fetched values,  but even so, if you used up all the points I recommend you ***subscribe again with another mail address*** but dont forget the restart the project after you changed the api key on your ```.env```file

* if you did the above;

    > - download the project to your local.
    > - add the api key to your .env
    > - ```npm install```[```package.json``` file includes the dependencies that you will be needed ].
    > - you can see the app in ```localhost:3000```
